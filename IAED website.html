                <h4>HTML vs PDF</h4>
                <p>PDF, which stands for Portable Document Format, is a type of file format that was developed by Adobe. PDF files retain the appearance of the document regardless of what platform is used to view or print it. The most commonly used and reliable PDF viewer is Adobe Acrobat software. There are also other PDF softwares that can be used to prepare PDF files, such as PDFCreator, PDF factory pro, and PrimoPDF.
